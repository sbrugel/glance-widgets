# sbrugel's Glance Widgets

Custom widgets I've made for the Glance self-hosted dashboard

## MLB Scores Tracker

*Based on the [NBA Scores Tracker by ShmoobiJones](https://github.com/glanceapp/community-widgets/tree/main/widgets/nba-scores-tracker-by-shmoobijones)*

Displays MLB scores for all recent/current/upcoming games by default, but can also display games for a specified team (based on city abbreviation).

Options:

- **team** (optional): The city abbreviation of the team you want to filter games to. Based on ESPN's abbreviations, i.e. "PHI" = Phillies, "SEA" = Mariners

TODO:
